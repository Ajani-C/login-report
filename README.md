Problem Statement: Imagine that you're an IT specialist working in a medium-sized company, 
your manager wants to create a daily report that tracks the use of machines. 
Specifically, she wants to know which users are currently connected to which 
machines, it's your job to create the report. In your company, there's a system 
that collects every event that happens on the machines on the network. Among the 
many events collected it records each time a user logs in or out of a computer. 
With this information, write a script that generates a report of which 
users are logged in to which machines at that time.
